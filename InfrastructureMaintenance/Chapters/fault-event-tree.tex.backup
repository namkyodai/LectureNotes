\section{Event tree analysis - Theory}
\subsection{Definition}
Event tree analysis (ETA) is a way to analyse and display different discrete
scenarios, their corresponding probability of occurrence and the resulting
consequences. ETA uses Boolean logic to analyse a chronological sequence of
events and estimate the probability of their occurrence. A key component of event
tree analysis is the event tree. An event tree is built from a starting event and
branches at each subsequent event based on the values of key parameters these key
parameters were intensity measures. When the event tree is complete, it is a
logical and visual representation of the set of scenarios that can occur, i.e.
multiple possible futures. An example is shown in Figure \ref{figeventfault:1}, the
initiating event is a 100-year precipitation, which may result in the occurrence
of a flood with water depths over 30 cm, under 30 cm, or not at all. In this
example, the flood can lead to different damage states related to an
infrastructure element, which can result in interruptions to traffic flow on the
road network. The consequences of the scenarios can then be quantified. Also the
heavy rain itself can cause an interruption.

ETA is often referred to as having forward logic as it starts from an initiating
event and ends at a consequence. It is often used to analyze the risks associated
with systems, and the consequences of functioning or failed systems given that an
event(s) has (have) occurred. Simply the construction of an event tree can often
be useful in decision situations as it brings to light many scenarios that
decision makers otherwise would not have considered.

When conducting an ETA it is necessary to first determine the starting events
that are to be considered and then to think through each of the next possible
events to be considered. Each chain of events from initiating events to the end
event (or consequence) is referred to as a path, and may be thought of as a
scenario.

At each node in the event tree, the tree branches. There are often only two
branches that emanate from a node but it is possible that no split occurs or that
many splits occur. It is, however, of utmost importance to ensure that the split
represents mutually exclusive possibilities, i.e. if one possibility happens the
other cannot happen. The end events are often referred to as consequences.

The construction of an event tree requires knowledge about the system.
\subsection{Steps}


The basic steps to conduct an event tree analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define static system: Determine what you would like to model and what is not to
be considered in the model
\item Define dynamic system: Determine what you would like to model over time. For
example, what hazards are of particular concern, e.g. flooding, what physical
things may happen, e.g. bridge collapse, what consequences might occur, e.g.
horrendous increases in travel times due to traffic jams
\item Identify specific initiating events: For example, heavy rain fall.
\item Identify specific intermediate events: For example, overtopping of a bridge
\item Construct the event tree
\item Calculate the probabilities of occurrence of each event: One possibility is
using fault tree analysis.
\item Calculate the probability of occurrence of each scenario or path:
\item Calculate the overall risk:
\item Evaluate the acceptability of the risk associated with each scenario and
overall:
\end{itemize}
%
Due to the almost infinite number of ways to represent reality and the almost
infinite number of events that can occur, an appropriate system representation
needs to be developed. A good starting point is often the system representation
used to determine that there was a problem. It needs, however, to be verified
that this representation is adequate for the evaluation of the candidate
strategies. The necessary detail to be used depends on the specific question, the
strategies to be evaluated and the level of detail desired.
\subsection{Example in literature}
Please read the research work of Beim \& Hobbs 1997, who constructed a event
tree analysis for a lock gate system, as part of the script.

\subsection{Question A}
You are the road manager responsible for a particularly risky section of road.
It consists of a bridge that crosses a river and is just below a steep
embankment, upon which it is known that avalanches sometimes occur. This is
illustrated in Figure \ref{figeventfault:2}.

You suspect that there are substantial infrastructure related risks due to both
flooding and avalanches but would like to quantify the risks. Develop an event
tree to allow you to do this.
